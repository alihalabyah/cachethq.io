            <p>Cachet is an open source status page system, written in PHP with the <a href='http://laravel.com'>Laravel 4.2</a> framework. Having been developed to support hobby projects, small business to a large enterprise, Cachet is the perfect solution to your status updates.</p>

            <h1>What does it do?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Keeps your users, customers or developers up to date with service level information</li>
                <li>Supports customization at a theme level and supplying a complete stylesheet</li>
                <li>Comes with a beautiful and responsive dashboard for adding incidents from anywhere</li>

            </ul>

            <h1>What is it not?</h1>
            <p>Cachet is <strong>not</strong> a system health checker, it doesn't monitor your services and update when something has gone wrong. For something like that, you could check out <a href='https://uptimerobot.com'>Uptime Robot</a> and <a href='https://pingdom.com'>Pingdom</a>.</p>
